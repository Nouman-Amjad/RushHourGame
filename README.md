# Rush Hour Game

## Overview
Rush Hour Game is a 2D car simulation game developed as part of my Computer Science degree at FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad. This project was designed to enhance programming fundamentals, including the use of data structures, algorithms, and OpenGL for graphics rendering.

## Features
- A colorful and interactive gameplay environment.
- Multiple car types (red, yellow, and blue) with unique movement patterns.
- Obstacles and passengers are placed dynamically on the map.
- Scoring system:
  - Earn points by avoiding obstacles and picking up passengers.
  - Lose points for collisions or delays.
- Interactive menus for gameplay options and leaderboard display.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL
- **Additional Tools**: CImg for image processing.

## How to Play
1. Select your taxi color (Red or Yellow).
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate the taxi around the game grid.
3. Avoid obstacles like trees and buildings.
4. Pick up passengers and drop them at their destinations to earn points.
5. View the leaderboard to track top scores.

## Game Controls
- `Arrow Keys`: Move the taxi.
- Avoid collisions to maximize your score.

## Installation and Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nouman-Amjad/RushHourGame.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RushHourGame
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./RushHourGame

## Files
- **game.cpp**: Main game logic and rendering.
- **util.cpp** & **util.h**: Utility functions for graphics and mathematical computations.
- **Makefile**: Build configuration for the project.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more challenging levels with increasing difficulty.
- Introduce multiplayer mode for competitive gameplay.
- Enhance visuals with advanced shaders and textures.
